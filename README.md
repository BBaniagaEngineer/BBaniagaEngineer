Hi,  I'm Brandon Baniaga
I'm interested in all things related to engineering
I'm currently learning object-oriented programming at the University of Hawaii Manoa
I'm originally from Kalihi, Hawaii
I'm a senior in Electrical Engineering
I chose this major because I want to design and learn about all things in the electrical field
A fun fact about me is that I played college football for 4 years
What do I want to learn from EE 205? I want to further my knowledge in the programming field by being proficient in the C and C++ language.
A book  or movie that I recommend: The Bible
